# Predicting-Cancer-Using-Gene-Data

The goal of this notebook: Classification of Cancer by Gene Expression. 
To show how new cases of cancer can be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray). 
Thereby providing a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. 
The data below shows patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their respective gene expressions for over 7000 genes.

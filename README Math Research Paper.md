# March Madness Bracketology Sports Ranking Methods
In March Madness we use Bracketology to predict outcomes of sports brackets. As with any sports,

sports betting is a huge industry. Every year billions of dollars are bet on many major sports tourna-
ments,including march madness. Bracketology offers two effective methods in predicting the outcomes

of these brackets thus revealing important over/under gambling odds, which are an essential part in the
sports betting world. More specifically bracketology uses two main methods. First it uses the Massey
Method, based on the theory of least squares, which ranks teams by point differential. Secondly it uses
the Colley Method based on Laplace rule of succession, which ranks teams on a modification of winning

percentage. We apply these methods to help predict outcomes of March Madness brackets. We com-
pare results of these methods with each other, and with real results from an actual bracket to analyze

their efficacy and the differences between them. More generally, these proposed methods offer a flexible
approach to conditional density forecasting for a broad class of applications.
